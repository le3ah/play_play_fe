# Play Play FE

A Turing School pair project in our last module at the Turing School of Software & Design.  We were tasked with developing a full-stack application in a language new to us (i.e. - no RoR for the backend).  For the frontend, we used jQuery.  You can visit our backend data at [PlayPlay](https://protected-fortress-76604.herokuapp.com).  Our frontend is deployed through github.io and can be found at [PlayPlayFE](https://le3ah.github.io/play_play_fe/).
